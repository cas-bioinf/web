We strive to provide support for all projects related to bioinformatics, including statistics and general programming. We are almost always available for consulting, but unfortunately cannot accomodate all requests for larger collaborations due to our limited capacity.

# Get in touch!

In any case: if you need bioinformatics/programming/statistics help, do not hesitate to arrange a meeting via e-mail [bioinformatics@biomed.cas.cz](mailto:bioinformatics@biomed.cas.cz) or ask on [Prague Bioinformatics Slack](https://bioinfo-prague.slack.com/). There is a lot of stuff we don't know, but we can often connect you with someone who does.

# Some stuff we know

We would be particularly happy to help with:

* Statistics 
* Metagenomics
* Genome assembly
* Differential expression
* Designing plots and other graphical displays of data
* Programming problems
* ... and more!

But really, just get in touch!
